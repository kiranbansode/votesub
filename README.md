## Why I built the project this way ?

## Goals behind building VoteSub project

1. to show my students the power of Computer technologies(yes, I was a teacher)
2. create a webapp where my students can vote their favorite teacher or school subject(original idea for VoteSub) depending on weekly performance or teaching styles of teachers
3. want to impress my future employers or HR by showing my development skills

## Feature of VoteSub

1. give votes to favorite candidates of particular subject from vote bank
2. register according user type. (different user will have a slightly different registration form )
3. create new subjects and candidates for other users to vote
4. view realtime votes
5. view voting history on daily basis separated by each subject and number of total votes given to a particular candidate
6. view information using Profile page
7. remaining votes counter(realtime)
8. Admin Panel where subject owner can do CRUD operations(coming soon)
9. Setting Page where users can change appearance of webapp(coming soon)
