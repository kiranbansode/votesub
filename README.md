## Goals behind building VoteSub project

1. to show my students the power of Computer technologies(yes, I was a teacher)
2. create a webapp where my students can vote their favorite teacher or school subject(original idea for VoteSub) depending on weekly performance or teaching styles of teachers
3. want to impress my future employers or HR by showing my development skills

## Feature of VoteSub
